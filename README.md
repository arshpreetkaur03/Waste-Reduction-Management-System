Our platform's core functions, including inventory management, transaction processing, and user authentication, are handled by the business layer. It ensures that business rules are uniformly applied across the platform, supporting essential operations like tracking down extra food items, managing stakeholder transactions, and updating inventory.

## 

## 5.3 Layer of Database

As the backbone of the platform, our data layer controls the archiving and retrieval of user, inventory, and transactional data. It is designed to guarantee data integrity, consistency, and security and supports essential operations including inventory management, transaction tracking, and user profile management.

# Business Architecture

## 6.1 Login and registration

![6.1 Use Case](Images/6.1%20Use%20Case.png)

This use case diagram outlines the processes for "Login" and "Registration" on the Food Waste Reduction Platform. Here's an explanation of each part:

Login Use Case:

1\. Login: This is the main action that a user begins with when they want to access their account.

2\. Enter Username/Password: This step is included in the "Login" use case and represents the user providing their credentials to the system.

3\. Validate Information: Another step included in the "Login" process where the system checks if the provided username and password are correct and match an existing user in the database.

4\. Grant Access: If the validation is successful, the user is granted access to the system. This is the final step in the login process.

Registration Use Case:

1\. Enter Username/Password: Just as in the login use case, the user starts by entering a chosen username and password.

2\. Choose User Type: After providing the initial credentials, the user selects what type of user they are (e.g., Retailer, Consumer, Charitable Organization). This categorization is crucial for defining the user's role and permissions within the platform.

3\. Validate Information: Like the login use case, the information entered during the registration process is validated. This likely includes checks for data format, uniqueness of the username/email, and possibly password strength.

4\. Save User Data: Upon successful validation, the user's data is saved to the system, creating a new user account.

Overall, the diagram provides a high-level overview of the steps involved in user authentication and account creation on the platform.

## 6.2 Inventory Use Case

![6.2 Use Case](Images/6.2%20Use%20Case.png)

The use case diagram depicts the functionality within the Inventory Management System for the Food Waste Reduction Platform. Here's a brief explanation:

1\. Inventory: This likely represents the system that is the focal point for managing inventory-related activities. It is the main functional area being described.

2\. Add new items: This use case represents the functionality that allows users (likely retailers) to add new food items to the inventory.

3\. Update Quantities: This use case enables users to modify the quantity of existing food items in the inventory.

4\. Set Expiration Date: A specific use case where users can set or update the expiration dates for food items in the inventory. This is crucial for tracking and managing perishable goods.

5\. List Surplus Items: This use case involves the functionality to list items that are determined to be surplus so that they can be sold at a discounted rate or donated.

6\. Identify Surplus Food: It is linked with an \<\<extends\>\> relationship to "List Surplus Items". This relationship suggests that identifying surplus food is an additional action that extends the basic "List Surplus Items" functionality.

## 6.3 Retail Sales Use Case

![6.3 Use Case](Images/6.3%20Use%20Case.png)

The use case diagram for a Retail Sales System within the Food Waste Reduction Platform outlines the interactions between the system and its users for the sales process. Here's a breakdown of the diagram:

1\. Browse Items: This use case represents the user's ability to look through the items available for sale. It is a fundamental step in any retail system, allowing users to find products they might want to purchase.

2\. Purchase Items: Once a user has found an item they wish to buy, this use case covers the process of making a purchase. The "Purchase Items" use case includes the "Browse Items" use case, suggesting that browsing is a necessary part of the purchasing process.

3\. Update Inventory: This use case is likely included after a purchase is made to reflect the change in inventory levels. It is an included step in the purchase process, indicating that when a purchase is made, the inventory must be updated accordingly to maintain accurate stock levels.

4\. Transaction Details: This use case relates to an "extends" relationship to the "Purchase Items" use case. This suggests that recording the transaction details is an additional step that doesn't always occur as part of the standard purchase flow but may be initiated under certain conditions, such as when detailed receipts are requested, or for high-value transactions where more information is needed.

In summary, this diagram is detailing the steps involved when a customer interacts with the retail sales system to browse, purchase, and trigger inventory updates, as well as potentially provide detailed transaction records under certain circumstances.

## 6.4 Charitable Organization Use Case

![6.4 Use Case](Images/6.4%20Use%20Case.png)
The use case diagram titled "Food Waste Reduction Platform Charity Food Claim System" represents the process that a charitable organization would follow to claim food items. Here is a description of the use cases depicted:

1\. Claim Item: This is the central use case around which the other actions revolve. It represents the action of a charitable organization claiming items that retailers have listed as available for donation.

2\. List Food Items to be Claimed: This use case likely extends the "Claim Item" process. It represents the functionality where the charitable organization can view a list of food items available to be claimed.

3\. Update Inventory: This use case also extends the "Claim Item" action. It represents the system's process of updating inventory levels once an item has been claimed.

4\. Claimed Items List: This extends the "Claim Item" use case too. It suggests that after claiming an item, there's an option to review a list of all items that have been claimed. This might be used for record-keeping or reporting purposes within the charitable organization.

## 6.5 Surplus Food Alert Use Case

![6.5 Use Case](Images/6.5%20Use%20Case.png)

The use case diagram illustrates the Surplus Food Management System's notification subsystem within the Food Waste Reduction Platform. The diagram describes how users interact with the system to receive notifications about surplus food. Here's a breakdown of each use case:

1\. User Subscription: This is likely the initial use case where users can subscribe to receive notifications. It forms the basis for the other actions related to notification settings.

2\. Notification Alerts: Central to this diagram, it represents the system's capability to send out alerts to users. This use case includes several other use cases, meaning it requires the information from these to send notifications effectively.

3\. Location: This included use case suggests that users can specify their location preferences for receiving alerts about surplus food nearby.

4\. Phone/Email: Another included use case indicating that users can choose their preferred method of communication, such as phone or email, to receive alerts.

5\. Food Preferences: This use case, which is also included, implies that users can set specific food preferences for the alerts they want to receive, such as types of food or dietary restrictions.

6\. Surplus Food List: While it's not directly connected to "Notification Alerts," this use case is likely a central feature of the system where the list of surplus food is managed and maintained.

## 6.6 Bonus Functionality

A bonus feature is that Consumer and Charitable Organization are able to give feedback to the retailer and the retailer is able to view them through the view feedback tab.


# Detailed Design

When we're building software, it's important to map out how everything fits together. That's where detailed design comes in. It's like creating a blueprint for a house before you start building it. One essential part of detailed design is making UML diagrams. These diagrams help us see the big picture of our software by showing us the different parts and how they connect.

In this section, we'll focus on one type of UML diagram called the class diagram. Think of it as a map that shows all the classes in our software, what they do, and how they're related.

# Data Architecture

![ERD](Images/ERD.png)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) provided above shows the data architecture for the Food Waste Reduction Platform. It outlines the database structure, indicating how different entities within the system are related and the nature of these relationships.

## 8.1 Architecture Explanation

This ERD illustrates the data architecture of the platform, defining how various entities such as users, items, transactions, and subscriptions are organized and interrelated. The use of primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) establishes relationships between entities, which are essential for database normalization and ensuring data integrity.

The architecture allows for tracking the lifecycle of food items from being stocked in inventory, identified as surplus, and then either claimed by charitable organizations or purchased by consumers. Transactions serve as a historical ledger for purchases, and subscriptions enable the system to target users with relevant alerts.

## 8.2 Entities and Their Attributes

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) comprises several interconnected entities that define how the platform manages and utilizes data. Here is an explanation of the data structure:

1.  Users- This table is at the core of the platform. It serves as the primary reference point for other entities that represent actions or attributes related to the users, like their purchases, claims, inventory, and subscriptions.
1.  Inventory- Inventory represents the stock of food items that retailers have available. This table is related to the Users table through the RetailerId, connecting each inventory item to its respective retailer. It includes information like quantity and price, which are crucial for managing the supply side of the platform.
1.  SurplusFoodItems- The SurplusFoodItems table captures information about food items that are in excess and need to be either sold or donated before they expire. It extends from the Inventory entity to highlight items that have become surplus. This entity also links back to the Users table, showing which retailer the surplus items belong to.
1.  Claims- This table records the actions of charitable organizations as they claim surplus items for donation purposes. It links to the Users table through the CharitableOrgId, indicating which organization made the claim. It also references the SurplusFoodItems through the ItemId, specifying which items are being claimed.
1.  Purchases- The Purchases table logs the transactions where consumers buy surplus items. It contains foreign keys to both the Users table (as ConsumerId) and the SurplusFoodItems table (as ItemId), establishing the connection between the consumer and the specific items they've purchased.
1.  Subscriptions- This entity manages the subscription details for users who wish to receive updates and notifications about surplus food availability. The UserId foreign key links subscriptions to the specific user in the Users table, while additional attributes like Location and FoodPreferences personalize the subscription service.
1.  TransactionHistory- The TransactionHistory table is a comprehensive record of all financial transactions on the platform, be they related to sales or claims. This table ties transactions back to the users through the InitiatorUserId and the specific items through the ItemId. It includes details such as transaction type, quantity, total value, and status.

## 8.3 Relationships

1\. Users to Inventory: One-to-Many, indicating that a retailer can manage multiple inventory items.

2\. Users to SurplusFoodItems: One-to-Many, showing that retailers list multiple surplus items.

3\. Users to Claims: One-to-Many, allowing charitable organizations to claim many surplus items.

4\. Users to Purchases: One-to-Many, consumers can have multiple purchase records.

5\. Users to Subscriptions: One-to-Many, users can subscribe to various types of notifications.

6\. Inventory to SurplusFoodItems: One-to-Many, depending on each inventory item can be listed multiple times as surplus.

7\. SurplusFoodItems to Claims: One-to-Many, a surplus item can have multiple claims.

8\. SurplusFoodItems to Purchases: One-to-Many, a surplus item can be purchased by multiple consumers.

9\. SurplusFoodItems to TransactionHistory: One-to-Many, each item can be involved in multiple transactions.

10\. Users to TransactionHistory: One-to-Many, a user can initiate multiple transactions.
